    "App routing in Flask refers to the mechanism by which we match incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate function or view handler in our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use app routes in Flask to make our application dynamic and handle various types of user requests. By defining different routes, we can create different views within our application that handle different functionalities such as displaying a webpage, accepting user input, processing data, or returning a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Routes are used to ensure that the correct function or view handler in our application is executed based on the URL requested. For example, a route may be defined for the homepage of our application, another route may be defined for processing login requests, and another may be defined for retrieving data from a database.\n",

    "Overall, app routing allows our Flask application to process different types of user requests and dynamically generate responses based on the requested URL, improving the user experience and functionality of our application.\n"
